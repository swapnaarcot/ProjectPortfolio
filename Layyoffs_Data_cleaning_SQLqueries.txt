Data Cleaning:


Pre-requisite-Take a new staging table which is a copy of the raw table.--layoffs_staging table

Step 1: Removing duplicates:

-----------Query to check duplicates using row numbers-------------------

with dup_cte as
(
select company,location,industry,total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,l_date,stage,country,funds_raised_millions,
row_number() over(partition by company,location,industry,total_laid_off,
percentage_laid_off,l_date,stage,country,funds_raised_millions order by company)rn
from layoffs_staging)
select * from dup_cte where rn>1;

---Create a second staging table to remove duplicate rows and add data from above query(select)--

insert into layoffs_staging2
select company,location,industry,total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,l_date,stage,country,funds_raised_millions,
row_number() over(partition by company,location,industry,total_laid_off,
percentage_laid_off,l_date,stage,country,funds_raised_millions order by company)rn
from layoffs_staging;

select * from layoffs_staging2 where rn>1;

----Delete the rows having rownum>1-----------

delete from layoffs_staging2 where rn>1;

Step 2: Standardizing data:Finding issues in the data and fixing it

--Removing the preceding and trailing spaces---
update layoffs_staging2
set company=trim(company);


---Removing Industry names that have duplicate names for same industry------
update layoffs_staging2
set industry='Crypto' 
where industry like 'Crypto%';

-----Removing training . from country name------------

 update layoffs_staging2
set country=trim(trailing '.' from country)
where country like 'United States%';

-----Altering the Date column type from text to date---------
alter table layoffs_staging2
modify column l_date date;

----Replacing the null values from columns--------------

To check the null values in 'Industry' field ,merge using self-join(similar to update)  is used:

select t1.company,t2.company,t1.industry,t2.industry from layoffs_staging2 t1
join layoffs_staging2 t2
on t1.company=t2.company
where t1.industry is null
and t2.industry is not null;


merge into layoffs_staging2 t1
using
(select distinct company,industry from layoffs_staging2 where industry is not null)src
on (t1.company=src.company)
when matched then
update
set t1.industry=src.industry
where t1.industry is null;


------------Remove the records with null values for 2 or more related columns--------------------

delete from layoffs_staging2 where
total_laid_off is null and percentage_laid_off is null;


-----Remove temporary working column from table------------------------------------

alter table layoffs_staging2
drop column rn;
